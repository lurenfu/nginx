I will add a useful module which is name ngx_http_xcgi_module.c for nginx. This module will make the developers easier to developing CGI programms with C programming language for embedded devices. PHP/Python/Ruby/Node.js is sometimes too heavy for embedded devices, and C language is more appropriate.
